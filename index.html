        <h3> Hello! I'm Kevin. Welcome to All the Places I've Been!</h3>
        <small>(I also go by JKev if you're more of a nickname person) </small>
        <p> I have lived and visited more than a few places over the course of my relatively short life, and it has affected me profoundly in the way that I live my life, conduct my work, and view the world around me.</p>
        <br>Let me guide you through this map I've created, and tell you a little bit about each place I've lived and how they have shaped who I am.</p>
        <p style="color:red">Red Dots: Places I've lived</p>
        <p style="color:blue">Blue Dots: Places I've visited</p>
        <small>(I've selected some major spots, it's not a complete list)</small>
        <p style="color:black">Black Lines: Trails I've backpacked (look near Cusco and in Southern Chile)</p>
        <p>Click anywhere to fix a point, then click another spot to form a line. Click the same point again to delete it.</p>
        <small>Now, play connect the dots and let me know what awesome shapes you've come up with!</small>

        <h3>Where I've Lived</h3>
      </section>
      <section id= 'new york'>  
      <h4>New York &amp; Boston</h4>
<p>Born in New York, raised in Boston. The youngest of four, I'm outnumbered by Yankees fans, but luckily the last 17 years or so have been a good time to be a Boston sports fan. This time of my life was, as it is for everyone, foundational. I played every sport I could, had a small army of Star Wars toys and Beanie Babies, milked Windows 95 for all it was worth, and my parents still managed to instill the importance of hard work and a good education.</p>
      </section>
      <section id= 'florida'>
      <h4>Florida</h4>
<p>My dad got a job in Naples, FL my second year of high school, and we moved down to a place vastly different from New England in just about every way imaginable. I learned the &nbsp;value of starting fresh and reinventing yourself while also appreciating how your local environment and culture can affect how you live and view the world.</p>
        </section>
      <section id= 'holy cross'>
      <h4>Holy Cross</h4>
<p>As the world becomes increasingly automated, I think the value of creative, non-linear, non-repetitive thought is increasing as well. Holy Cross taught me how to learn: to think and write critically and form opinions independently, to question the world in front of us and seek&nbsp;<em>magis&nbsp;(</em>the more) from our lives.</p>
      </section>
      <section id= 'dublin'>
      <h4>Dublin, Ireland</h4>
<p>I spent a semester studying at University College Dublin while at Holy Cross. It was an immense privilege to be able to experience another country (even if Ireland is pretty westernized and English-speaking, there are still cultural differences), travel through Europe, and connect in a deeper way with my Irish background (I'm an Irish Dual-Citizen and have a number of cousins living there). It peaked my interest in international travel, which would influence me a few years down the line. See below!</p>
      </section>
    <section id= 'juneau'>
      <h4>Juneau, AK</h4>
<p>The Jesuit commitment of "men and women for others" at Holy Cross inspired me to pursue a year of service with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps Northwest, which brought me to Juneau, AK, doing outdoor recreation working with people experiencing disabilities. We inspired independent living and skill-building through hiking, rock climbing, kayaking, and just about any other outdoor activity you can think of. I also learned the importance of getting to know the individuals that you work with. Everyone has a story that affects their worldview, and particular strengths and weaknesses as a result. I learned not to make assumptions because of someone's background and to capitalize on individuals' strengths to accomplish our group goals. I never thought that adaptive skiing or rock climbing would translate into skills in the professional world!</p>
<p>I liked Juneau so much, I didn't leave for another three and a half years. I worked in economic development and tourism marketing and explored the mountains and glaciers of Alaska on an almost daily basis.</p>

      </section>
    <section id= 'everything else>
      <h4>Woodstock, Vermont, Cuba &amp; South America</h4>
<p>I'm sure these two locations don't get put together very often. Alaska was a beautiful place, but I was stagnating professionally, and ready for a change. I took my passion for sustainable business, tourism marketing experience, and desire for international travel and combined it all into a sustainable adventure travel blog, <a title="Landscapes on the Run" href="http://landscapesontherun.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landscapesontherun.com</a>. I sold most of my belongings and moved to Vermont, where my parents live, before taking off to Cuba and South America, seeking out sustainable travel experiences everywhere I went. I spent a month in Lima learning Spanish, and the following four months fumbling over my words with increasing proficiency through Chile, Bolivia and Peru again.</p>
<p>I took a 1 second of video just about every day and compiled it into one. Take a look at it here:</p>

<h4>And now?</h4>
                                    </section>
<p>Emerson said: "Always do what you are afraid to do." To that end, I'm seeking to continually scare myself: Reinvent myself like I did in Florida; continue to learn every day and question the world around me as I learned at Holy Cross; experience new perspectives and cultures (Ireland and South America); and pursue work that contributes to something larger than myself.</p>
